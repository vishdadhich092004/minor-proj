# Fix 404 Error on Vercel

## The Problem
When deploying a Flutter web app (SPA) to Vercel, you get a 404 error because Vercel doesn't know to route all requests to `index.html`.

## Solution: Configure SPA Routing

### Method 1: Via Vercel Dashboard (Quick Fix)

1. Go to your Vercel project dashboard: https://vercel.com/dashboard
2. Click on your project (`admin_panal`)
3. Go to **Settings** → **General**
4. Scroll down to **"Redirects and Rewrites"** section
5. Click **"Add Rewrite Rule"**
6. Configure:
   - **Source:** `/(.*)`
   - **Destination:** `/index.html`
   - **Permanent:** Leave unchecked
7. Click **Save**
8. Go to **Deployments** tab
9. Click the **"..."** menu on your latest deployment
10. Click **"Redeploy"**

### Method 2: Redeploy with vercel.json (Better)

1. The `vercel.json` file is now in `admin_panal/build/web/` directory
2. Go to Vercel Dashboard → Your Project
3. Go to **Deployments** tab
4. Click **"..."** on latest deployment → **"Redeploy"**
   OR
5. Drag and drop the `admin_panal/build/web` folder again (it now includes `vercel.json`)

### Method 3: Via Vercel CLI

```bash
cd admin_panal/build/web
vercel --prod --yes
```

## Verify It Works

After redeploying, your app should:
- Load at the root URL: `https://your-project.vercel.app`
- Work when navigating to different routes
- Not show 404 errors

## Why This Happens

Flutter web apps are Single Page Applications (SPAs). When you navigate to a route like `/dashboard`, the server needs to serve `index.html` instead of looking for a `/dashboard` file. The rewrite rule tells Vercel to always serve `index.html` for any route, allowing Flutter's client-side routing to work.

## Still Getting 404?

1. Check browser console for errors
2. Verify `vercel.json` is in the deployed folder
3. Check Vercel deployment logs
4. Make sure base href in `index.html` is `/`
